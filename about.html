		<h3 id="hi-there">Hi there!</h3>

		<p>I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/codingdash">Ritesh Shrivastav</a>. I live in India. I’m enthusiastic programmer, I love thinking and implementing my thoughts. I started programming 7 years back when I was the student of bachelors. I earned my Bachelor’s with Computer Application from <a href="http://rsmt.ac.in/">RSMT, Varanasi</a> in 2011 and Masters in Computer Application from <a href="http://www.srmuniv.ac.in/">SRM University</a> in 2014.</p>

		<h4 id="how-i-work">How I work?</h4>

		<p>My first code I had written for saying “Hello” to the computers in my favourite language C. But I feel that learning a language is not interesting than knowing how it works. I started with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">Basic</a> when I was in high-schools, later in under graduation I learned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C language</a> and developed basic applications and mini-games.</p>

		<p>Later in I got to know about .NET framework and worked in windows development environment with C# then C++, Java, PHP.</p>

		<p>I love researching and learning new things.</p>

		<h4 id="why-blogging">Why Blogging?</h4>

		<p>I do blogging to share my thinking to the readers like you, and I love to listen from the developers and the thinkers. When I watch my code I find new ways to solve problems like that the blogging is the way, which can teach me some part of stuffs like code, nature and the world.</p>

		<h4 id="before-here">Before here?</h4>

		<p>Before starting the Coding Dash, I was blogging on <a href="http://www.computerknow.org">Computer Knowledge</a> which was basically for computer users. The Computer Knowledge blog I began in Jan 2010 when I was studying in graduation for sharing solutions to those problems what I’ve stuck while I was learning.</p>
