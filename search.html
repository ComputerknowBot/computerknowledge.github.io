  Searching a content oriented website is easy as doing a google search for specific content.

---
<p>Google is famous for the brilliance of its algorithm for searching web pages, 
so why we don't take advantage of such tools? To search content on specific 
website, we trigger a search by appending <b>site</b> parameter in following ways-</p>

<p>
	&lt;Search term&gt; <b>site:computerknow.org</b>
</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Query</th><th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tr>
		<td>&lt;Search term&gt; <b>site:computerknow.org</b></td>
		<td>Returns result for given terms.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>"&lt;Search term&gt;" <b>site:computerknow.org</b></td>
		<td>Returns result for given terms, without breaking the token.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
