Apple's next operating system will be called Yosemite. Apple has shown it's preview new OS 10.10 at WWDC 2014, it's worldwide developers conference and also listed on it's website apple.com [here](https://www.apple.com/osx/preview/){:target="_blank"}. In this new OS X Yosemite article we'll discuss the new features Apple has announced.

### OS X 10.10 Yosemite launch date
Apple has confirmed that the next version of OS X will be available for registered developers now.  
Yosemite will also be available this summer as a beta to the first million Mac users who register for Apple's Beta program at [www.apple.com/osx/preview](www.apple.com/osx/preview){:target="_blank"}.
The final version of Yosemite will launch to the public in the autumn, according to Apple. We can't be sure which date Yosemite will launch this autumn. In 2010, Apple announced OS X 10.7 Lion in October before releasing it to the public in July 2011. In February 2012, OS X 10.8 Mountain was announced before being rolled out in July 2012. Most recently, Apple announced OS X 10.9 Mavericks in June 2013 before making it available to the public in October 2013.
With OS X Mavericks not launching until October 2013, it is seems likely that Apple will release its new Yosemite operating system in a similar time frame.

### Yosemite price details
Apple has confirmed that Yosemite will be free, as was OS X Mavericks. 

### How to get the OS X Yosemite beta
Developers can already get their hands on the OS X Yosemite beta, but what about the rest of us? Apple started allowing non-developers to download beta versions of OS X Mavericks this April, and now, with the launch of Yosemite, Apple is allowing interested consumers to sign up to take part in the Beta program. If you are one of the first million people who sign up for the public beta of OS X Yosemite at [www.apple.com/osx/preview](https://www.apple.com/osx/preview){:target="_blank"} you will be able to get your hands on Yosemite this summer â€“ but note, you will be a tester providing bug reports so don't expect a polished operating system. 
Opening up the beta program this way should allow Apple to get much more data, and theoretically that should result in a better system when it is ready for launch. Third-party developers will also benefit as they will be able to test their software publicly on Yosemite before it is released, which should mean that your essential apps will work when the new OS is ready to go live.

### New features will Mac OS X Yosemite have
  - Apple has revealed some of the new features in the next OS X. New features and improvements include AirDrop between Mac and OS X.
  - There are also various improvements coming for Notification Centre, including a Today view, which gives you a quick look at everything you need to know. Notification Centre also gains Widgets, which it seems are no longer relegated to Dashboard.
  - iCloud Drive lives in the new look Finder and means that the documents you create on your Mac and iOS devices will be available on all your devices and in all your apps. It's Apple's answer to DropBox.
  - Safari has a new streamlined design and a cleaner interface. The Tab View gives you an birds eye of your open tabs so it's easy to find what you are looking for. It's possible to set up a window for Private browsing, and when you search the results are no longer just limited to Google.
  - Mail has improvements for editing PDFs and images, and sending large attachments.
  - Yosemite also offers what Apple is referring to as Continuity features to make your Mac and iOS device perfect companions.
  - AirDrop has been on the Mac since Mountain Lion, and means users can drop files between nearby Macs. With iOS 7, iOS devices got the AirDrop feature too. But unfortunately, Mac and iOS devices cannot currently AirDrop between each other. Luckily this will change with iOS 8 and Yosemite.
  - The new Handoff technology means that all your devices are linked up so that you can switch from one device to another and carry on where you left off whether you were in the middle of composing an email, or browsing a webpage.
  - You can get SMS and MMS messages on your Mac - text messages as well as iMessages!
  - And you can make or receive phone calls using your Mac as a speakerphone. It's almost as if the large screen iPhone is going to be your Mac!
