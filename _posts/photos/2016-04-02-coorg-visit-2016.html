<p>Coorg, also known as Scotland of the India is situated in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodagu_district" target="_blank">Kodagu district</a> of Karnataka state. Coorg is known to many as the land of peaceful forests and hills, weekend retreats, coffee plantations, and home to the only community in India thatâ€™s allowed to carry a gun without a permit.</p>

<p>I had a chance to visit this place in the end of March. The place is situated in the stack of hills, where I was able to see the beauty of nature and to wonder about the place. The place has its own history and importance. In the cover of this post you can see how beautiful it is, when we see it from the top. We stayed in a vintage villa, which was approximately 6 km far from the ground and situated on the top of the hill. The hills are completely covered by trees and coffee plants. This is that kind of a place where you can pass hours staring at the magnificence of nature with a curled up book, perhaps.</p>

<p>The languages presently spoken in Kodagu are Kodava, Are Bhashe, Kannada, Kasaragod Malayalam, Yerava, Kuruba, Konkani, Urdu, Tulu and English. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodava_language" target="_blank">Kodava language</a> is the native language of this place, which is different than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada" target="_blank">Kannada</a>.</p>

<p>The morning of Coorg is beautiful and amazing. After we woke up, the first thing we loved was the fresh mint tea and that too without milk. It was made of mint leafs, cardamom, ginger, lavang and a small amount of sugar.</p>

<p>Here are photos that prove this point.</p>
